Project Header
The header of the project contains my name, as well as a profile picture of me, and includes a background image and is styled so that the padding is an appropriate size for a header and the image is shape to be more round.

Nav Bar
The nav bar was created by adding 4 links to the bar that included the major sections of the webpage. Each of the links will take you to the section of the webpage, and will highlight in a different color when the mouse is hovering on them.

Sections
The sections of the webpage are organized based off of their information. The images are placed similarly to the mockup and a border separates the headings from the information.
